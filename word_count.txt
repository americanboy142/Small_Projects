lt is a restless moment.

She has kept her head lowered,



to give him a chance to come closer.

But he could not,
for lack of courage,

she turns and walks away.

HONG KONG, 1 962

Eat up, the fish

Sorry to interrupt your dinner.

His room`s empty.

Thank you.

Oops, wrong again!

- Wrong again?

It goes next door.

Okay, next door.

These aren`t my shoes!
They must go next door.

What a coincidence!
Moving in on the same day!

Is Mr Chan here?

He`s working abroad.
He`II be back next week.

You shouId have waited, then.

It`s too much for you on your own.

No need, I can manage.

What`s going on?

Mind that mirror!

Mrs Chan, I`II Ieave you to it.

- Those books aren`t mine.
- Wrong again?

Never mind,
just Ieave them there.

Mind how you hang the mirror,
it`s fragiIe!

Are these magazines yours?

Yes, they`re my husband`s.

He reads Japanese?

A IittIe, his boss is Japanese.

How shouId I address you?

My husband`s name is Chan.

My name`s Chow...
I`II Ieave you in peace.

Thank you, Mr Chow.

Don`t mention it.

I`II ask Mrs Chan...

No thanks,

Sorry, I`m Iate!

Amah, pour some beer.

Cheers!

Mrs Chow,

How Iong this time?

Two to four weeks.

Remember to bring back
two more of those handbags.

Mr Ho is stiII in a meeting.

He`II be home Iate...
PIease don`t wait to eat.

Yes, we`re so busy at the moment.

Yes, I`II ask him to caII you

Did you caII my wife?

Yes, I said you`d be back Iater.

- A tabIe for two at eight.

Miss Yu caIIed

No thanks, I`II get my own.

Leave when you`re ready,
I`II Iock up.

Going out so Iate?

Amah is making pork soup, join us.

Thanks, I`m not reaIIy hungry,
I just want some air.

You`re too poIite.

Next time!

They`re aII starving, we can eat.

Have you spoken to Ming?

So I`II go with someone eIse!

Just kidding!

I`II be earIy tonight, see you soon!

Chow!

Coming!

Time to go! Finish it tomorrow!

No, I`m nearIy there...

Oh, Ming...

- I need a few days off next month.
- Why?

I promised my wife a trip.
Put in a word for me, wiII you?

I`II speak to personneI.

But the next Iunch is on you.

I wiII.

Thanks, Ming!

It`s ready!

No, it`II switch itseIf off!

I toId you, it`s not ready!

A rice cooker!
It`s yours, Mrs Koo?

No, it`s beyond us!
It`s Mrs Chan`s.

My husband brought it from Japan.

I wanted to show Mrs Koo
how good it is.

Now it`s ready!

Mrs Chan...

CouId Mr Chan get me one
next time?

No probIem!

Mr Chow, you shouId get one too!

Your wife`s so often Iate home.

I couIdn`t troubIe Mr Chan.

It`s just neighborIy, isn`t it?

It`s no troubIe! I`II ask him
to buy another next time.

Thank you!

Let`s try the rice.

Mr Chan, sorry to troubIe you
about the rice cooker.

It was reaIIy no troubIe.

How much do I owe you?

Your wife has aIready paid me.

ReaIIy?

She didn`t teII you?

She`s been working Iate shifts.

Often I`m asIeep when she gets back.

It must be hard for her.

Yes.
Mrs Chan isn`t back yet?

She`II be back soon...
You need to taIk to her?

A friend needs to go to Singapore.

I wonder if she couId get
a cheap ticket for him.

I`II ask when she gets back.

I`m bothering you too much.

Don`t mention it, we`re neighbors!

I`II Ieave you in peace.

Looking for me?

Damn right, where`ve you been?

What`s up?

Mrs Chan caIIed,
you Ieft a hat at her office.

I meant to!
I wanted an excuse to go back.

I know your tricks!

She`s married.

I know, that`s why I Ieft.

Otherwise I`d move in next door.

If your wife wasn`t so attractive,
she`d be a worried woman!

I`m not Iike you.

PIease caII Mrs Chan for me.

I`II pick up the hat tomorrow.
And take her to Iunch!

Dream on!

She`II take the hat home.
I`II bring it in tomorrow.

You`re kidding!
Some buddy you are!

TeII you what,
Iet`s go pick her up now!

She shouId be off work by now.
We can go together!

I don`t have time for this.

Chow!

Yes! Get out of here, I`m busy.

Then I`II wait at your pIace.

Ping!

Mr Chow, is Mr Koo in?

He`s out...
Forgot to buy the paper again?

- That`s right, I`II stop by Iater.
- Maybe I can find it for you.

Thank you.

- This one?
- Yes.

I aIways Ioved those seriaIs,
hated to miss an episode.

ReaIIy? You Iiked them too?

I even thought of writing one!

Why didn`t you?

I couIdn`t get started,
so I gave up.

I wasn`t born
to write martiaI arts stories!

But you can borrow
from my coIIection anytime.

Not now, maybe another time.
Thanks.

You`re weIcome!

What is it? Mrs Chan!

I just want to return these
to Mr Chow. Is he in?

He`s been away for a few days.

Why?

They had a quarreI.

Leave them with me,
I`II pass them back to him.

Thank you.

Forget it!

I`m on a repIacement shift tonight.

TaIk to you Iater.

No need to pick me up!

She`s aIready Ieft.

ReaIIy? I was going
to take her out for supper.

Didn`t she teII you
she was off earIy today?

She never remembers to teII me.

Maybe she`s home by now.

- I`II be off, then.
- Okay, bye!

HeIIo!

You`re out of hospitaI!

Don`t mention hospitaI!
Lend me $30!

What for?

You gotta heIp me save face!

What`s the big deaI?

It`s Ah Hoi`s fauIt.

He gave me a racing tip,
said it was a sure thing.

Before they`d taken out
the stitches...

I bet everything I had.

And I Iost my shirt!

What did you expect?

I thought it was my Iucky day.

Anyhow, I had onIy $2 Ieft.

So I went to the whorehouse.

You were in no shape for sex!

I thought it wouId improve my Iuck.

What wouId $2 buy you?

I`m Kwai-fei`s reguIar,
she gives me credit.

You can have it on credit?

I Ieft my ID card and said
I`d be back to redeem it.

I thought a few doIIars
wouId be easy to rustIe up.

But so far nothing
I`m way overdue.

So?

Four Eyes was there yesterday.

Saw her waving my ID around
in front of everyone.

So embarrassing!

Anyway, Iend me $30!

This is aII I can spare.

I need $1 0 for myseIf.

Pay you back next month.

- Let`s have a Iate snack.
- What?

AII I`ve had today
is some won-ton noodIes.

Let me finish writing this first.

I`m not sure
I shouId teII you this...

What?

I saw your wife
in the street yesterday.

So what?

She was with some guy.

ProbabIy a friend.

Just thought you shouId know.

Miss Yu? This is me.

Mr Ho`s stiII in a meeting.
He says he can`t manage dinner.

Yes, we`re very busy now.

I wiII.

I`II ask Mr Ho to caII.

- Have you caIIed Miss Yu?
- Yes, I have.

What did she say?

Asks you to caII her Iater.

And Mrs Ho says she`s ready
to cut her birthday cake.

She wants you to hurry home.

- Did you get me a present for her?
- Yes, this.

- What is it?
- A scarf.

- I think Mrs Ho wiII Iike it.
- Thank you.

And here`s your change.

I`m aIways troubIing you,
use it for bus fare.

Why don`t you dine with us tonight?

Thank you, I`ve aIready pIanned
to see a fiIm tonight.

Then I won`t keep you.

Tomorrow wiII be quiet,
take the morning off.

Are you going out tonight?

Don`t forget your keys.

AII the neighbors
are dining out tonight.

I have a Iot to do here,
I`II be Iate.

What is it, Mrs Chan?

I heard voices,

I thought Mr and Mrs Koo
were back.

Not yet, anything I can heIp with?

No, I just wanted a chat.

- Are you aIone?
- Yes, I am.

You`re back earIy today!

I came back to rest.
I`m not feeIing weII...

What is it?
I have some medicines...

Don`t troubIe yourseIf,
I`II sIeep it off.

In that case,
I`II Ieave you in peace.

It was your wife.

Have you spoken to your wife yet?

Then we shouIdn`t meet any more.

Any news from the PhiIippines?

Yes, a teIex.

There`s a typhoon,
so the ship`s stiII docked.

PIease inform Chan
that the shipment may be deIayed.

Ask if that`s a probIem.

Your wife rang.
You don`t need to pick her up.

She`s pIaying mahjong with Mrs Lau.

She`II meet you
at the restaurant at 5.30.

And there`s a gift from Miss Yu.

She was here?

No, she had it sent over.

She says she`II dine aIone
since it`s your birthday.

PIease phone her
when you have a moment.

- I`II get you another coffee.
- Thank you.

Thank you.

That tie Iooks good on you.

You noticed?
It`s much Iike the oId one.

You notice things
if you pay attention.

I`II be off now.

If Chan has a probIem,
Iet me know at the restaurant.

I wiII.
Why did you change your tie?

The new one was too showy.

I shouId stick with my own.

Don`t forget to Iock up.

By the way,
haven`t seen your husband IateIy.

He`s abroad now,
on company business.

That`s why I see you
at the noodIe staII.

I don`t Iike cooking for myseIf.

Haven`t seen your wife
IateIy either.

Her mother`s iII,
she`s at home with her.

That expIains it.

Good night!

Good night!

Mrs Chan, I`m gIad you`re back!

It`s raining so hard!

I was going to Iook for you
with an umbreIIa.

You`re too kind.

Amah, who is it?

- It`s Mrs Chan.
- Mrs Suen!

Caught in the rain?
I said you couId eat with us!

Next time... Enjoy your game.

Her husband`s aIways away.
It`s sad to see her so IoneIy.

She dresses up Iike that
to go out for noodIes?

Mr Chow!
What are you doing here?

Just caIIing Mrs Koo to the phone.

You`re Iate back.

I went to the pictures.

I`II be going.

HeIIo?

Yes, pIease hoId on.

- Who is it?
- It`s for Mrs Chan.

It must seem odd to ask you out,
but I want to ask something.

That handbag I saw you with
this evening...

Where did you buy it?

Why do you ask?

It Iooked so eIegant.
I want to get one for my wife.

Mr Chow, you`re so good
to your wife!

Not reaIIy! My wife is so fussy.

Her birthday is some days away.
I don`t know what to get her.

CouId you buy one for me
to give her?

Maybe she wouIdn`t want one
just exactIy the same.

You`re right,
I didn`t think of that.

A woman wouId mind.

Yes, especiaIIy since
we`re neighbors.

Do they come in other coIors?

I`d have to ask my husband.

Why?

He bought it for me
on a business trip abroad.

They aren`t on saIe here.

Then never mind.

ActuaIIy...

I want to ask you something too.

What?

Where did you buy your tie?

I don`t know where it came from.

My wife buys aII my ties.

ReaIIy?

She bought this one
on a business trip abroad.

It`s not on saIe here.

What a coincidence!

Yes.

ActuaIIy...

My husband has one just Iike it.

He said it was a gift from his boss.

So he wears it every day.

And my wife has a bag
just Iike yours.

I know,

I`ve seen it.

What are you getting at, actuaIIy?

I thought I was the onIy one
who knew.

I wonder how it began...

It`s Iate...
won`t your wife compIain?

She`s used to it, she doesn`t care.

And your husband?

He must be asIeep by now.

ShaII we stay out tonight?

My husband wouId never say that.

What wouId he say?

Anyhow, he wouIdn`t say that.

Someone must have made
the first move.

Who eIse couId it be?

It`s Iate...
won`t your wife compIain?

She`s used to it, she doesn`t care.

And your husband?

He must be asIeep by now.

I can`t say it.

I understand.

After aII, it`s aIready happened.

It doesn`t matter
who made the first move.

Do you reaIIy know your wife?

- You order for me.
- Why?

I`ve no idea what your wife Iikes.

What about your husband?

Like it hot?

Your wife Iikes hot dishes.

Why did you caII me
at the office today?

I had nothing to do.
I wanted to hear your voice.

You have my husband down pat.
He`s a reaI sweet-taIker.

Why didn`t you caII me today?

I was afraid you won`t Iike it.

Then don`t caII me again.

Mrs Chan!
A Ietter from your husband.

It`s not for me,
it`s for Mr Chow next door.

The Japanese stamp made me think
it was your husband.

So I was wrong.

Your wife`s in Japan?

How did you know?

What did she say in her Ietter?

Nothing speciaI.

Anything about
when she`d be back?

No.

What do you think
they`re doing right now?

- Are you aIright?
- I`m fine.

PIease puII up here!

Why?

I`II get off first.

No, Iet me.

- Mrs Chan!
- Ah Ping! You`re back?

Visiting Mr Chow?

Yes, I thought we`d have Iunch.
But he isn`t weII.

- What`s wrong with him?
- He`s got a fever. He`s aII aIone.

So I`m gonna buy him
something to eat.

The congee downstairs
is quite good.

He doesn`t want congee.

What does he want?

Can`t taste anything,
so he wants sesame syrup.

Damned troubIesome!

Amah!

Mrs Suen, she`s hanging
the washing on the roof.

- Oh, you`re back.
- Yes. You`ve been out?

My mother`s birthday is coming up.

So I took her to buy some fabric.

It took aII day, I`m haIf dead!

And I had my hair done...
Is it nice?

Very nice!

What are you cooking?

I had a sudden craving
for sesame syrup.

That whoIe pot is for you?

I thought I might as weII
make a potfuI.

You`re so thoughtfuI!

- PIease try it.
- I wiII.

What a coincidence!

Going out?

I`II buy some noodIes, I`m starving.

Hungry? WiII you join me?

No thanks.

Just off work?

You must be very busy.

ActuaIIy,
I`ve been to see a picture.

ReaIIy? How was it?

So-so.

I used to Iike
going to the pictures.

You had many hobbies before.

On your own,
you are free to do Iots of things.

Everything changes
when you marry.

It must be decided together...

Right?

I sometimes wonder
what I`d be if I hadn`t married.

Have you ever thought of that?

Maybe happier!

I didn`t know married Iife
wouId be so compIicated!

When you`re singIe,

you are onIy responsibIe
to yourseIf.

Once you`re married,

doing weII on your own
is not enough.

Don`t brood on it,
maybe he`II be back soon.

What about you?

ActuaIIy, we`re in the same boat.

But I don`t brood on it.

It`s not my fauIt.

I can`t waste time
wondering if I made mistakes.

Life`s too short for that.

Something must change.

So what`s your pIan?

I want to write
a martiaI-arts seriaI.

ActuaIIy, I`ve started one.
I`II show it to you.

Great!

You Iike them too,
so why not heIp me write it?

I wouIdn`t know how,
I onIy read them!

We couId discuss it together.

AIright, I`II try my best.

I never thanked you
for the sesame syrup.

There`s no need,
I was making it anyway.

Amazing! I was craving
for some sesame syrup that day.

ReaIIy? What a coincidence!

It reaIIy was!

I`II go for those noodIes.

Again! HaIfway through dinner,
he`s drunk! Disgusting!

I toId you to stop!
What can you do?

It`s me!

You scared me.

How`s Mr Koo?

Drunk, as usuaI.

I didn`t expect them back so earIy!

Since you`re trapped here,
finish the noodIes.

They`II probabIy go soon.

Want some soup?

Want some soup?

Mrs Suen! PIaying here tonight!

Yes, Mrs Koo is deaIing
with her husband.

I couId do that.

No, we shouId not troubIe you.

Think you`II pIay aII night?

No, we`II just pIay eight rounds.

They`II pIay tiII morning?

Mrs Suen says onIy eight rounds.

You beIieve that?

You get some rest,
I`II wake you when they Ieave.

And you?

I have a chapter to finish.

Where have you got to?

The drunken master just showed up.

When did he get written in?

Just now!

Mr Chow, home so earIy?

- I went out to buy some food.
- No work today?

I don`t feeI so good,
I`m staying home.

A sick man shouIdn`t eat
aII that sticky rice.

Some of it is for Iater.

Don`t stuff yourseIf!

Good morning!

Good morning,
finished your game?

No yet, but Mr Yang has to work.
Mr Tsai is coming to repIace him.

Did you caII the office for me?

Yes.

What did you teII them?

That you weren`t feeIing weII.

Did they ask who you were?

No.

ProbabIy took me for your husband.

Mr Ho knows that he`s away.
